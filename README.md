## About Me
I'm a graduate of the Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy.  I'm currently a teaching fellow for the same program. I love coding and roller derby, so this is my passion project to combine the two. I skate for Gotham Girls Roller Derby in New York. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaborating, coming to a game, or just to say hi.
